# Browser Automation Scripts

## Introduction

This project contains a collection of browser automation scripts designed to streamline various tasks and gather valuable data directly from web pages. Currently, it includes a single script for Glassdoor that downloads a list of companies with good ratings in CSV format.

### Current Script

- **Glassdoor Company Ratings Scraper**: Automates the process of extracting a list of companies with high ratings from Glassdoor and saves the data as a CSV file.

## Future Plans

Additional scripts will be added in the future to automate more tasks and enhance data collection capabilities. Stay tuned for updates!

Feel free to explore the existing script and check back for new additions.
