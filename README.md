# Browser Automation Scripts

## Introduction

This project is created to automate various small tasks and streamline data collection from different websites and social media applications. The current focus is on providing scripts that simplify routine tasks and gather useful information.

### Current Script

- **Glassdoor Company Ratings Scraper**: Automates the process of extracting a list of companies with high ratings from Glassdoor and saves the data as a CSV file.

## Future Plans

Additional scripts will be added in the future to automate more tasks and enhance data collection capabilities. Stay tuned for updates!

Feel free to explore the existing script and check back for new additions.
